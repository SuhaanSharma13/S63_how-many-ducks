# 🦆 "How Many Ducks?" – The Worst Duck Counter  

## Overview  
**"How Many Ducks?"** is a fun web app where users upload an image, and the site attempts to count ducks—badly. Using AI (or pure randomness), it misidentifies objects, provides nonsense commentary, and delivers hilariously inaccurate results.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Image Upload** – Upload an image for "analysis."  
✅ **Duck Detection** – AI (or random logic) attempts to count ducks.  
✅ **Deliberate Misidentification** – Mistakes random objects for ducks.  
✅ **"Enhance Ducks" Mode** – Adds cartoon ducks to "fix" the count.  
✅ **Funny Messages** – Generates absurd explanations.  
✅ **Leaderboard** – Tracks the highest (and most ridiculous) duck count.  
✅ **Social Sharing** – Share your duck results online.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React (Next.js), TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) / Python (Flask or FastAPI)  
- **AI (Optional)**: TensorFlow.js or YOLO  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase Storage / AWS S3
